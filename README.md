We can’t rely on CPU time to measure algorithm efficiency because it depends on external factors like hardware, operating system, programming language, and background processes. It also only reflects performance for a specific input size and doesn’t show how the algorithm scales as input grows. Therefore, we use Big O analysis, which measures efficiency independently of the machine or environment.
