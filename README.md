Question 1 :We can’t rely on CPU time to measure algorithm efficiency because it depends on external factors like hardware, operating system, programming language, and background processes. It also only reflects performance for a specific input size and doesn’t show how the algorithm scales as input grows. Therefore, we use Big O analysis, which measures efficiency independently of the machine or environment.Time complexity shows the actual performance of an algorithm independently of the system.

Question 2 :
1+1 = 2 Q(1)

Question 3 :
a) O(n)
b) O(n^2)
c) O(log n)
